# Transaction Analysis AI Tools Documentation

This document outlines the AI tools designed for transaction analysis and insights, including detailed algorithms for
each tool.

## Overview

The TransactionService provides comprehensive AI tools for analyzing transaction data across multiple dimensions:
financial metrics, pattern recognition, performance analytics, temporal analysis, and user behavior insights.

## Data Model Context

- **Transaction Entity**: amount, currency, type (DEBIT/CREDIT/TRANSFER/REFUND), status (
  PENDING/COMPLETED/FAILED/CANCELLED), userId, description, referenceId, timestamps
- **Existing Tool**: `getTotalIncome()` - calculates total credit transactions for a date range

## 1. Financial Analysis Tools

### 1.1 getTotalExpenses()

**Purpose**: Calculate total debit transactions (expenses) for a given period
**Algorithm**:

```
INPUT: startDate, endDate, userId (optional)
1. Query all DEBIT transactions with COMPLETED status
2. Filter by date range [startDate, endDate]
3. If userId provided, filter by specific user
4. SUM(amount) for all matching transactions
5. Return Money object with total and currency
```

### 1.2 getNetCashFlow()

**Purpose**: Calculate net cash flow (income minus expenses)
**Algorithm**:

```
INPUT: startDate, endDate, userId (optional)
1. totalIncome = getTotalIncome(startDate, endDate, userId)
2. totalExpenses = getTotalExpenses(startDate, endDate, userId)
3. netFlow = totalIncome - totalExpenses
4. Return CashFlowResult with income, expenses, net flow, and analysis
```

### 1.3 getAccountBalance()

**Purpose**: Calculate cumulative account balance based on transaction history
**Algorithm**:

```
INPUT: userId, asOfDate (optional, defaults to now)
1. Query all COMPLETED transactions for user ordered by createdAt ASC
2. Initialize balance = 0
3. For each transaction:
   - If CREDIT or REFUND: balance += amount
   - If DEBIT: balance -= amount
   - If TRANSFER: handle based on context (in/out)
4. Return BalanceResult with current balance and transaction count
```

### 1.4 getSpendingByCategory()

**Purpose**: Analyze spending patterns by extracting categories from descriptions
**Algorithm**:

```
INPUT: startDate, endDate, userId (optional)
